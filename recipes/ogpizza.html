    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The original Napolitan Pizza! Undeniably light, flavourfull and just simply amazing. Every chef should have this recipe stored away under their belt for guests. I can't count how many times I've had a get together with friends, over pizza and wine. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg 00 flour</li>
            <li>600 ml water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>drizzle of extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>tomato based pizza sauce</li>
            <li>fresh mozzarela </li>
            <li>basil</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For this easy Neapolitan pizza dough recipe, pour 2.5 cups of water into the bowl from your stand mixer and add 10%/100g flour.</li>
            <li>Mix this well using your stand mixer (or in a bowl with your hands).</li>
            <li>Next add the yeast and mix again for around 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Then, add 50% of your leftover flour (approx. 450g).</li>
            <li>Mix this at a low speed and allow it to become creamy and smooth. Increase the speed and while this is mixing, add some more flour just a bit at a time until there is none left.</li>
            <li>Once you have added the final amount, increase the speed again and knead this for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Switch off the mixer then remove the attachment and touch the dough; it should be nice and sticky but completely combined.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour on your kitchen bench/wooden board then remove the easy neopolitan pizza dough from the bowl and place it on top.</li>
            <li>If there is any excess flour remaining, add it to the top of the dough and mix it in by folding the dough over then add the salt and knead it again.</li>
            <li>Put the dough back into the stand mixer bowl and mix it again using your preferred attachment for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes, peel the dough from the hook and place it onto a bench you have already dusted with flour.</li>
            <li>Shape the easy neopolitan pizza dough into a ball and then move it around using the palm of both hands on each side of the ball to finish it off.</li>
            <li>To check if the dough is ready, press down using just one of your fingers. If it quickly bounces back, it’s ready – if not, you might need to knead it a little more.</li>
            <li>Now place it into a large stainless steel bowl and cover it tightly using plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough to rest at approx. 15-16°C/59/60°F for between 16-20hr/overnight. If it is too warm in your house, leave it in a cool place then place it in the fridge before you go to bed and by morning it should be just perfect.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is ready, remove the plastic wrap, dust your hands with flour and slowly pull at each of the edges to remove it from the bowl then place it on a surface dusted with some flour too.</li>
            <li>Get the tray you are using to rest your dough balls and sprinkle some flour on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Cut pieces from your dough (or break them using your hands) and measure them to be 250g/8.8oz.</li>            
            <li>Create a ball like shape by folding your fingers into the bottom of the dough and turning it around. Repeat until you’re happy with the shape, then place it on your table/bench and you’re done!</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 18- 19 then place each ball in the container/tray leaving room on either side of them.</li>
            <li>Cover this well then wait at least 4 hour before using the balls.</li>
            <li>Dust flour onto the surface you are using and place a ball on top. Gently press down into the dough using your fingers, turning the dough in a circular motion as you begin to stretch it out – but don’t touch the edges!</li>
            <li>Press down to create a crust all the way around and once it has increased in size, lift the pizza, turn it and slap it down on to the table. This motion needs to be swift and confident. Repeat a few times then finalise the shape – don’t overwork it and don’t worry if it’s not a perfect circle!</li>
            <li>Remove any excess flour from your bench, place the dough (stretched out) on top and add tomato/basil sauce and your favourite ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>How to cook and Serve</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°C – 750°F</li>
            <li>Spread (freshly crushed, peeled) san marazano tomato sauce, mixed with fresh basil and a pinch of salt over the top and add a sprinkle of Pecorino romano along with mozzarella and salami (or whatever you choose!)</li>
            <li>Gently transfer your pizza onto a pizza peel and into the oven.</li>
            <li>Cook the first edge for 45 seconds then move the pizza around and cook the next edge for 15 seconds and the following for another 15 seconds too.</li>
            <li>The pizza should have spots of golden brown all over the crust, if it does not; put it back in for just a few more seconds.</li>
            <li>Let it rest for a minute or so – slice and enjoy!!/li>
        </ol>
